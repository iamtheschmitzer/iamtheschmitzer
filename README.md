## Hi I'm Jeff

About me:

* Problem-solver - My motivation has always been solving the most difficult problems in a way that requires a different way of thinking.
* Financial Experience - I worked in market data at Bridge Information Systems/Reuters and later as a consultant.  In addition to having equity and market data knowledge,  I also have a strong understanding of fundamentals, options, analytics, corporate actions, financial statements, history, charting and trading.
* Quality Focus - I have a deep focus on code quality - in producing the easiest to maintain, most extensible, and highest performing code base, including even how branches get broken into commits.
* Engineer and Leader - Even while moving into leadership roles at various times in my career, I have always continued to provide individual technical contributions to my team on a daily basis.

Projects I have done solo or led a small team:
